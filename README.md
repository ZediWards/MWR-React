### This will be a React app that will 
  1. give users the ability to submit Maintenance Work      Requests to the database.
  2. Display a "leader board" that shows submitters name and number of submits they have completed. 
  3. Display a MWR dashboard that shows all submitted MWR's and their status (in progress, denied, pending). 


### Storage
At first the app will store all information from React state into the browsers local storage. 

After getting a good grasp on that method of storing data, the app will be adjusted to save the data on a serverless database. 

If not a serverless database, then it will utilize Express.js for API and Postgres for database. This way a company can host everything within their local servers.
